ReadingBar's main features include:

- A screen ruler that attaches to your mouse or trackpad cursor for you to hold under each line of text.
- A highlighter that you can move over each line, or several lines, of text.
- A spotlight that helps you focus on specific area, wherever your cursor is.
- A screen tint that overlays a colour of your choice on any screens attached to your Mac.
- A menu bar icon and customisable keyboard shortcuts for quick and easy use.

Think of ReadingBar as the on-screen equivalent of holding a bookmark under each line as you read. The bar attaches to your cursor; simply move it around with your mouse or trackpad. Your eye will naturally track the bar, making it easier to scan each line rather than jumping around the page. You can choose a style that suits you - bar, highlight, or spotlight - and customise the size and colour to suit your preference.

Also included is a simple screen tint, which reduces visual stress by reducing the harsh contrast of black text on a white page. Choose whichever colour and opacity is most comfortable for your eyes. If you have multiple displays, you can select which screens to tint, so that you can have a tinted screen for text and a normal screen for images.

Additional features:

- A menu bar icon that changes to indicate whether the reading bar and screen tint are active.
- The menu bar icon can be hidden if your menu bar is short on space.
- Only the content of your screen is tinted, menus and alerts remain clear.
- Use special system and developer colours to auto-switch with dark mode.
- Also compatible with old Macs, all the way back to High Sierra (10.13).
